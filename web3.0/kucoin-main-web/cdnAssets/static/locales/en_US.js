From April 30th to August 7th, TRON has organized and prepared a bonus return (paid by USDT-TRON) activity with high rate of annualized returns to encourage users to convert USDT-OMNI into USDT-TRON. The activity will last until the early August. During the activity period, the USDT-TRON holders will get airdrop as bonus returns and the highest annualized rate of the return is up to 20%. {brandName} will offer full support to this activity and users transferring USDT into this activity will get the corresponding bonus returns based on the USDT amount. {brandName} will convert the USDT-OMNI and USDT-ERC20 into USDT-TRON and the TRON will release the bonus rewards as airdrops to users through {brandName}. <br/><br/>(1) In this activity, you could transfer in/out your USDT at your convenience. <br/><br/>(2) At 24:00(UTC+8) each day, {brandName} will take a snapshot of the USDT-TRON amount hold by users and calculate the corresponding bonus returns based on the USDT-TRON amount and the return rate of the day. <br/><br/>(3) The calculation of the return by 24:00(UTC+8) each day is based on the amount of USDT users transferred in before 16:00(UTC+8) that day. <br/><br/>(4) From 16:00(UTC+8) to 24:00(UTC+8) each day, if your total USDT-TRON amount increases, the increased part will be used for the return calculation of the next day at 24:00(UTC+8) and will not be used for the bonus return calculation of the day. Therefore, we suggest you transfer in USDT before 16:00(UTC+8) each day to get more bonus returns. <br/><br/>(5)Your bonus returns will be transferred into this activity directly.
